The attitude to issue.

from https://sing-box.sagernet.org/faq:

```
Why does sing-box not have feature X?
Every program contains novel features and omits someone's favorite feature. sing-box is designed with an eye to the needs of performance, lightweight, usability, modularity, and code quality. Your favorite feature may be missing because it doesn't fit, because it compromises performance or design clarity, or because it's a bad idea.

If it bothers you that sing-box is missing feature X, please forgive us and investigate the features that sing-box does have. You might find that they compensate in interesting ways for the lack of X.
